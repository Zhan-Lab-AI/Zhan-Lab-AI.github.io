## ðŸ“˜ Lab Handbook  

Welcome to the lab! This handbook outlines expectations, resources, and opportunities to help all members succeed.  

### âš¡ High-Performance Computing (HPC)  
We are working with several faculty and administrators to set up an **A100 HPC cluster** in the Computer Science department at NMT. This cluster will support large-scale AI, biomedicine, and interdisciplinary research.  
- Access and usage guidelines will be shared as the system becomes operational.  
- Please follow all university and lab-specific policies for HPC use.  
- Responsible usage is expected: prioritize research jobs, monitor resource consumption, and report issues.
- In the meantime, students can access HPC resources through **[RMACC](https://rmacc.org/)**.  
- We will have **early access to HPC@NMT with H200 GPUs**.    

### ðŸ•’ Lab Hours  
- I encourage students to **be on campus during working hours (9 AM â€“ 5 PM)** for collaboration.  
- Being physically present is **not mandatory**â€”flexible arrangements are supported.  
- Remote work is acceptable, but please remain **active and responsive on Slack** during working hours.  

### ðŸ‘¥ Group Meetings  
We hold **bi-weekly group meetings** to share progress, challenges, and ideas.  
- Each meeting features a **main presenter** (rotating among members).  
- Presenters should prepare a **50-minute formal presentation**, treating it as a chance to **practice professional talk skills**.  
- Please **post what you will present in Slack at least one day before the meeting** (e.g., research progress or a paper). 
- Discussions and feedback follow the presentation.
- The **group meeting schedule** is maintained online: [View Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDkTzn8bn9BI8fJJKCs_PTHSzBpq2cLp4Asdh8DtzEU/edit?usp=sharing)  
  

### ðŸ“– Reading Group  
We host a **reading group** to explore top AI/biomedicine journal and conference papers. 
- The reading group should be **led by students**.  
- Open to **all lab members**, and will later expand to *graduate students within CSE department** and **external presenters**.  
- Students interested in **leading sessions** are welcome to volunteerâ€”please let me know.  


### ðŸŒ± Professional Development  
- Members are encouraged to **attend conferences, workshops, and seminars**.  
- Opportunities for **co-authorship** will arise through collaboration.  
- I support career growth in both **academia and industry**â€”please discuss your goals so we can align projects accordingly.  

### ðŸ“¬ Communication  
- **Slack is the main communication channel** for day-to-day updates. Please keep notifications on and respond promptly.  
- Use email for formal communications and external contacts.  
- Share updates regularly to ensure smooth progress and collaboration.

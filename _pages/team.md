  <div class="team-text">

My name is Huixin Zhan. I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://nmt.edu/academics/compsci/index.php">Department of Computer Science & Engineering at New Mexico Tech</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://zhan-lab-ai.github.io/">Zhan Lab</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Department of Computational Biomedicine at <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Jason.Moore">Jason Moore</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University</a>, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/victor_sheng/index.php">Victor Sheng</a>. Previously, I had the pleasure to work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zijun-frank-zhang-7859a07a/">Zijun Frank Zhang</a>, who is now at Natera. I earned my MS at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and my BEng at Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, large language models, and graph neural networks, particularly their applications in text summarization, security, and privacy in both text mining and genomics data. My current research focuses on variant effect prediction using large language models, combining machine learning with genomics and biomedicine to develop predictive tools for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia. Additionally, I explore the application of large language models to biomedical challenges, focusing on enhancing in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for more effective knowledge graph-based reasoning.

My name is Huixin Zhan. I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://nmt.edu/academics/compsci/index.php">Department of Computer Science & Engineering at New Mexico Tech</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://zhan-lab-ai.github.io/">Zhan Lab</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Department of Computational Biomedicine at <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Jason.Moore">Jason Moore</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University</a>, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/victor_sheng/index.php">Victor Sheng</a>. Previously, I had the pleasure to work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zijun-frank-zhang-7859a07a/">Zijun Frank Zhang</a>, who is now at Natera. I earned my MS at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and my BEng at Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, large language models, and graph neural networks, particularly their applications in text summarization, security, and privacy in both text mining and genomics data. My current research focuses on variant effect prediction using large language models, combining machine learning with genomics and biomedicine to develop predictive tools for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia. Additionally, I explore the application of large language models to biomedical challenges, focusing on enhancing in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for more effective knowledge graph-based reasoning.

  <img src="/images/julia.jpeg" alt="Julia W. Cui" style="width: 200px; border-radius: 12px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <div>
    <p>Julia Cui is an Assistant Professor of Business Communication at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder. She investigates the intersections of communication, media, technology, and business practices.</p>

    <p>She holds a Ph.D. in Media and Communication from Texas Tech University, an M.S. in Mass Communication from San Jose State University, and a B.A. in Communication and Journalism from the University of Utah. Dr. Cui‚Äôs interdisciplinary training informs her expertise in interpersonal, intercultural, and mass communication, as well as business communication pedagogy and practice. In addition to her academic credentials, she is also a trained vocalist, which enriches her appreciation for the expressive and performative dimensions of human interaction. Dr. Cui‚Äôs current research explores human-machine communication and AI-human interaction across culturally diverse business environments. She examines how emerging technologies‚Äîsuch as large language models and AI-driven communication platforms‚Äîare reshaping leadership discourse, cross-cultural collaboration, and organizational resilience. Her work also investigates how individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds interpret meaning, establish trust, and build relationships through AI-mediated communication, raising important implications for ethical practice and business effectiveness.</p>

* <b>CSE 3021: Internet and Web Programming</b>, Fall 2025, New Mexico Tech, Socorro.

  This course teaches the foundational and modern principles of web development—from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to full-stack deployment. But it’s more than just code. Together, we will ask deeper questions:

  - What does it mean to exist on the internet?
  - Why do some personal websites feel “trustworthy” while others don’t?
  - Is your digital identity a representation—or a reinvention—of yourself?
  - Should scientists and engineers be responsible for curating their public presence?
  - How does technical design influence trust, perception, and reach?
  - Can web design choices introduce or mitigate algorithmic bias?
  - Can a viral website have more impact than a journal publication?
  - Is creating digital content a form of authorship—or performance?
  - Who controls your data, and do you control your online image?

* <b>EE 4583: Microcomputer Systems II</b>, Fall 2019, UTSA, San Antonio.

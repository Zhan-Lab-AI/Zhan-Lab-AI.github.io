* <b>CSE 3021: Internet and Web Programming</b>, Fall 2025, New Mexico Tech, Socorro.

  This course teaches the foundational and modern principles of web development—from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to full-stack deployment. But it’s more than just code. Together, we will ask deeper questions:

  - What does it mean to exist on the internet?
  - Can a well-designed website change your career?
  - Is your online identity your true self, or a curated persona?
  - Why do some personal websites feel “trustworthy” while others don’t?
  - Should scientists and engineers need to market themselves?
  - How does design influence emotion, ethics, or perception?
  - Are LinkedIn and personal websites the new academic resume?
  - Can a viral website have more impact than a journal publication?
  - Is creating digital content a form of authorship—or performance?
  - Who controls your data, and do you control your online image?

* <b>CSE 3021: Internet and Web Programming</b>, Fall 2025, New Mexico Tech, Socorro.

  This course offers an introduction to web development, with a focus on both front-end and back-end technologies. Students will learn to build interactive, accessible, and responsive websites—and deploy them publicly.

  **Technical topics include:**
  - HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox and Grid layout systems
  - JavaScript (ES6+), DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming
  - Accessibility and responsive design (WCAG guidelines)
  - Developer tools: VS Code, Git/GitHub, browser dev tools
  - Introduction to React (component-based design)
  - Node.js and Express basics
  - Building RESTful APIs and using `fetch()` for client-server communication
  - User sessions, authentication, and state management
  - Hosting static sites (GitHub Pages, Netlify) and project deployment

  Recently, I’ve been thinking about questions that connect technology to identity, career, and design. Here are a few questions for you to consider—if they resonate, this course may be a good fit:

  - What does it mean to exist on the internet?
  - Why do some personal websites feel “trustworthy” while others don’t?
  - Is your digital identity a representation—or a reinvention—of yourself?
  - Should scientists and engineers be responsible for curating their public presence?
  - How does technical design influence trust, perception, and reach?
  - Can web design choices introduce or mitigate algorithmic bias?
  - Can a viral website have more impact than a journal publication?
  - Is creating digital content a form of authorship—or performance?
  - Who controls your data, and do you control your online image?

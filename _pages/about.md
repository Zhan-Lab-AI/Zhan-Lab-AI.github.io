Welcome to the **Zhan Lab** at New Mexico Tech!

We build machine learning systems that connect large language models and foundational models with real-world scientific and societal challenges. Our work spans deep learning, structured reasoning, and human-AI interaction, with applications across genomics, medicine, robotics, and responsible AI.

## üî¨ Research Areas

- üß¨ **Variant Effect Prediction using Large Language Models**  
  We design LLMs to interpret genetic variants and predict disease relevance across cardiomyopathies and neurological disorders.

- üß† **Biomedical Knowledge Graphs & Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning**  
  Hybrid methods that combine neural models with structured biological knowledge.

- üîê **Privacy & Robustness in Genomic Models**  
  Studying adversarial attacks, fairness, and model bias for real-world deployment.

- ü§ñ **Agentic AI for Surgery and Rehab**  
  AI systems that analyze and collaborate in clinical actions such as surgical skill tracking and robotic rehabilitation.
